An `R` package for Bayesian meta-analysis that accounts for publication bias or *p*-hacking.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("publipha")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width='750px', dpi=200)
```

## Overview
publipha is an package for doing Bayesian meta-analysis that accounts for 
publication bias or *p*-hacking. Its main functions are:

* `psma` does random effects meta-analysis under publication bias with a 
   one-sided *p*-value based *selection probability*. The model is roughly the 
   same as that of [(Hedges, 1992)]((https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2246311.pdf))
*  `phma` does random effects meta-analysis under a certain model of *p*-hacking
   with a one-sided *p*-value based propensity to *p*-hack. This is based
   on the forthcoming paper by Moss and De Bin (2019).
*  `cma` does classical random effects meta-analysis with the same priors
   as `psma` and `cma`.

## Installation
Use the following command from inside `R`:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/publipha")
```

## Example Usage
Call the `library` function and use it like a bare-bones `metafor::rma`. The 
`alpha` tells `psma` or `phma` where they should place the cutoffs for significance.

```{r simpleuse, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("publipha")
# p-hacking model
set.seed(313) 
model = publipha::phma(yi = yi,
                       vi = vi,
                       alpha = c(0, 0.025, 0.05, 1),
                       data = metafor::dat.bangertdrowns2004)

```

## Documentation
Start with the introduction vignette and the companion paper (Moss, De Bin, 2019).
